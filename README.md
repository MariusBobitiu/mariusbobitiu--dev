<!-- ABOUT ME -->
## About Me

### üëãüèª Hello there!

Hi there! I'm **Marius**, a Full-stack Developer with a keen focus on crafting responsive and dynamic web applications using React. My journey in tech has been driven by a deep passion for solving problems and bringing ideas to life through code. With a strong foundation in React and an adventurous spirit for exploring the full tech stack, I strive to create seamless user experiences from front to back.

### üöÄ My Toolbox:
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Next.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript

### ‚ú® What Drives Me:
Innovation, clean code, and the endless pursuit of learning. I believe that every line of code is a step towards building something amazing‚Äîa tool, a website, a piece of software that can make someone's day just a little bit easier.

### üå± Currently Learning:
I'm on a continuous journey to sharpen my skills, currently diving deeper into TypeScript and exploring best practices in React development and testing. The tech world is ever-evolving, and so am I.

### üîç Looking Forward:
I'm excited about the future and the opportunity to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible. Let's code something incredible together!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **npm**: You need to have npm installed.
  - Visit the official Node.js website: [here](https://www.nodejs.org). Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux). Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Node.js.
  - Once you have node and npm installed, you can check on terminal or cmd by running `node -v` & `npm-v`. You should see the versions of Node.js and npm printed in the terminal, confirming that both are installed.
  - Optional: Update npm: npm is often updated separately from Node.js. You can update npm to the latest version using the following command: `npm install -g npm@latest`. This command installs the latest version of npm globally (-g).
- **MongoDB Database**: You will need a MongoDB database to store your projects.
- **MongoDB API Endpoint**: You need to have a MongoDB API endpoint configured. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project with the following content: `MONGO_DB_API= *https://your-mongodb-api..."`
  - You will need a mongodb database, and an endpoint. You can visit the mongodb [documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/data-api/) for instructions.

### Installation

Once you have everything you need, and you're ready to get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MariusBobitiu/mariusbobitiu--dev.git

2. Navigate into the repository
   ```bash
   cd mariusbobitiu--dev

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
This will start your project on ``http://localhost:3000``

### Other Commands

    npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


      npm run build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

    npm run eject

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
