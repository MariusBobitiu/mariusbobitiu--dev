        <p className="p-title">What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons? </p>
        <p className="p-text">Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an email including them. This allow us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</p>

        <p className="p-text">If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" className="p-link">Website Storage Settings Panel</a>.
          You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html" className="p-link">Global Storage Settings panel</a> and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to 'information' on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
